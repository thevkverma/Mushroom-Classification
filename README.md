## Mushroom-Classification

Using Machine Learning's Different Classifiers

•We analyzed the data in this study and developed a number of machine-learning models that can identify if a mushroom is toxic or edible based on its properties, such as the shape, color, and size of its cap and gills.

•Various classification models, including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest Classifiers, were employed in this study.

•We were able to obtain the precision, recall, f1-score, and support value by applying the machine learning classifier
